            Self-driven, highly motivated Full-Stack Web Developer with more
            than 2 years involved in the whole software development life cycle
            using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS, HTML, and Node. Proven
            ability to manage projects independently, meet deadlines, and
            deliver high-quality code. While my experience has been primarily
            freelance, I am eager to transition into a collaborative team
            environment where I can contribute my skills, learn from experienced
            professionals, and grow as a developer. I am a fast learner with
            excellent memory and the ability to quickly grasp and apply new
            concepts. I thrive in challenging environments and am comfortable
            navigating change. Very interested in machine learning,
            cloud-computing and AI programming.
